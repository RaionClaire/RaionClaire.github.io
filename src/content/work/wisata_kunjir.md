Desa Wisata Kunjir is one of the most serene coastal destinations in South Lampung—a place where soft waves, warm village hospitality, and scenic landscapes blend into a peaceful atmosphere. This website was designed to translate that experience into a digital form: a platform that presents Kunjir’s beauty while helping visitors navigate the village, explore attractions, and plan their trips with ease.

The project uses a **story-driven, tourism-focused design**, ensuring every section—from destinations and cultural highlights to culinary pages and interactive maps—feels like a guided journey. On the backend, the content structure was built to be lightweight and easy for local administrators to manage. Through a simple dashboard, the village staff can update photos, publish new attractions, highlight events, and maintain the site without technical barriers.
