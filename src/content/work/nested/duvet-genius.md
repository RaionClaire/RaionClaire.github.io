Welcome to our Face Recognition Attendance System! This project is designed to streamline attendance tracking using face recognition technology. With a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter and powerful image processing via OpenCV (cv2), taking attendance has never been easier! 🥳

Our face recognition attendance system is designed to recognize and record the attendance of individuals in real-time. The system uses OpenCV for detecting and recognizing faces, and Tkinter for creating an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

<b></b><h4>Features 🌟</h3></b><br>
<b>Real-time Face Detection: </b>Uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time. 📸<br>
<b>Face Recognition: </b>Identifies and verifies faces against a pre-trained dataset. 🧠<br>
<b>Attendance Logging: </b>Automatically logs the attendance of recognized individuals. 📝
<b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> Simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter.
